// A second real diff whose fs-import violation maps onto a DevDigest-SPECIFIC rule name
// (`core-no-node-builtins`, from architecture-reviewer.md's own rule table — verified against
// .claude/agents/architecture-reviewer.md:175, not invented) that a competent model will describe
// in prose but will not spontaneously name unless the agent forces a citation. The checkout diff's
// textbook violations don't discriminate this on their own — the model volunteers
// `inward-only-dependencies`/`di-discipline` either way.
//
// The second violation (skipping the mandatory `groundFindings()` gate) does NOT get its own
// citation requirement below: unlike the fs-import rule, no documented identifier exists for it
// anywhere in this repo — dependency-cruiser checks import graphs, not "was this function called",
// so there is nothing for even the strict agent to cite. A prior version of this case required an
// invented `reviewer-core-ground-findings-gate` identifier that appears nowhere in
// architecture-reviewer.md or any .dependency-cruiser.cjs; every model failed it honestly, on both
// variants, which discriminates nothing. Corrected 2026-08-28 — see evals/INSIGHTS.md.

// A diff that violates NO documented rule (a pure local-variable rename inside a domain file, no
// new imports, no cross-layer edges). A grounded reviewer should report zero violations. This
// surfaces the COST of relaxing the citation rule: freed from "every finding must name a
// documented contract", the lite variant is more prone to fabricating a judgment/best-practice
// finding where the strict variant stays silent.

// regardless of what changed. Deleted 2026-08-28 rather than fixed forward; see evals/INSIGHTS.md.
// If a lite variant is written later, this file's cases are still the right ones to share against it.
